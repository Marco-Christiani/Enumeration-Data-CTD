  <p class="lead text-white-50">You know how our family have named us, right? Them naming me <strong>M</strong> and you <strong>N</strong>. Well, our names are entirely the same except the initials. Life is too short to save names in your memory when you're old, so why not!
But do you know who did that? Our mother who was fond of the James Bond movies. She named me after her as <strong>M</strong>. Perhaps, she thinks that the director of the movie was too lazy to think of one.

I mean, who cares, right? Haha, I know you don't like me neither my pesky jokes. But I love you brother. So, don't visit this website until I am done. You'll find nothing but backups, lol.</p>
